Machine Learning Daily Practice

Welcome to my Machine Learning repository! This repository contains my daily practice code as 
I learn and explore various machine learning concepts, techniques, and algorithms. 
I am documenting my progress and sharing the code to track my learning journey and to possibly help others who are also on a similar path.


Overview

In this repository, you will find the code and notes related to my daily practice in machine learning. The main focus areas include:

-> Supervised Learning

-> Unsupervised Learning

-> Reinforcement Learning

-> Neural Networks and Deep Learning

-> Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

-> Model Evaluation and Tuning


Usage

You can explore the notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to follow along with my learning journey.
Each notebook contains detailed explanations and code snippets for the topic covered on that day.
